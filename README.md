# Diffusion models for speech synthesis

## Background

DiffWave approach [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09761]. 

## Data 
[https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/]

## Repo structure
This repo takes advantage of two frameworks: (1) Hydra for configs management and (2) Pytorch Lightning for improving our lives when colaborating and running experiments on different hardware. 

The particular approach of this repo is heavily inspired by [https://youtu.be/w10WrRA-6uI].
